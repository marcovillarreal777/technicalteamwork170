    <h1>Marco Villarreal</h1>
    <h2>User Manual</h2>
    <p> This is my first semester here at this college coming from Dallas Texas. Ive always liked computers, games, and wondered how they worked so this area of study felt like a no brainer.</p>
    <p> - I would say my style is pretty laid back but elevated from the average basic person.</p>
    <p> - I value kindness and attention the most out of people.</p>
    <p> - I dont have patience for large corporations or powerful people taking advantage of the people beneath them.</p>
    <p> - How to best communicate with me would probably be over instagram messenger because I dont check my text messeges normally.</p>
    <p> - How to help me best is to be very nonjudgemental. I already judge myeself enough so I dont need other people doing it to me.</p>
    <p> - What people misunderstand about me is that I think people think im mean or judgemental when im really not at all, nobody ever approaches me though.</p>
